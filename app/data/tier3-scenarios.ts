    context: 'Your store generates $85,000/month with a team of 3 (you + VA + part-time marketer). You spend 15 hours/week on tasks that feel repetitive: reviewing orders, approving refunds under $30, updating inventory status, generating weekly reports, and scheduling social media posts. These tasks are necessary but do not require human judgment.',
    challenge: 'Design an automation strategy that eliminates 80% of your repetitive operational tasks. What gets automated? What tools do you use? What stays manual and why? Calculate the time and cost savings.',
    optimalApproach: 'Automation tiers by complexity: Tier 1 — No-code automation (Zapier/Make): (1) Auto-forward CJ shipping notifications to customers with branded template. (2) Auto-approve refunds under $30 with template response. (3) Auto-generate weekly revenue/margin report from Shopify data. (4) Auto-post social media content from a pre-loaded content calendar. (5) Auto-tag customers by purchase behavior (new, repeat, high-value) in email tool. Time saved: 8 hours/week. Cost: $50-$100/month in tool subscriptions. Tier 2 — Semi-automated workflows: (6) Inventory monitoring — auto-alert when CJ stock drops below threshold, but human decides action. (7) Ad campaign reporting — auto-pull metrics but human analyzes and adjusts. (8) Customer service triage — auto-categorize tickets and draft responses, human reviews before sending. Time saved: 4 hours/week. Cost: $100-$200/month. Tier 3 — Keep manual: Strategic decisions (pricing changes, new product launches, brand partnerships), escalated customer complaints, financial planning, and any decision that could damage brand reputation. Total impact: 12 hours/week saved, $200/month cost — equivalent to hiring a $15/hour employee for 12 hours but with zero management overhead and 24/7 operation.',

    challenge: 'Build a European market expansion plan. Address: logistics and fulfillment, legal compliance (VAT, GDPR, consumer protection), localization, and market-specific marketing. What is the minimum viable expansion and when do you go all-in?',
    optimalApproach: 'Minimum viable expansion (Phase 1, months 1-3): Start with UK only. (1) Logistics: CJ has EU warehouses — route UK orders through CJ\'s UK/EU warehouse for 3-5 day delivery. (2) Legal: register for UK VAT (mandatory for selling to UK consumers above threshold). Display VAT-inclusive prices. Update privacy policy for GDPR compliance. Add mandatory cookie consent. Update return policy to EU consumer protection standards (14-day cooling-off period). (3) Localization: prices in GBP, UK English spelling, UK-relevant social proof. (4) Marketing: start with Google Shopping UK — purchase intent is high and measurable. Add UK-targeted Instagram ads featuring local lifestyle imagery. Phase 2 (months 4-6): If UK exceeds $15K/month revenue, expand to Germany and France. This requires: translated product pages (professional, not machine translation), local payment methods (Klarna for Germany, Carte Bancaire for France), and country-specific marketing.

    optimalApproach: 'Target portfolio: Facebook/Instagram 35%, Google/YouTube 25%, Email/SMS 20%, Organic/SEO 10%, Partnerships/Affiliates 10%. Channel buildout: (1) Google Shopping + Performance Max — capture high-intent search traffic. Reallocate 20% of Facebook budget. Expected ROAS: 4-6x within 2 months. (2) YouTube ads — use top-performing Facebook video creatives, run as in-stream ads targeting interest-based audiences. Lower CPM than Facebook with better attention. (3) Email/SMS — not a new acquisition channel but a retention multiplier. Build flows that generate $15-$20 revenue per subscriber per month. (4) SEO investment — hire a content writer, target 20 long-tail keywords per month. Traffic builds over 6 months but has zero marginal cost once ranking. (5) Affiliate program — offer 10-15% commission, recruit micro-influencers and niche bloggers. Self-funded customer acquisition. Attribution model: Use UTM parameters religiously.

    challenge: 'Design a supply chain resilience strategy that protects your business from supplier disruptions while maintaining operational simplicity. How many suppliers do you need? How do you manage relationships across them?',
    optimalApproach: 'Resilience framework: (1) Primary-secondary model — CJ remains primary (70% of orders) but establish a secondary supplier for your top 20 products. Candidates: AliExpress suppliers with ePacket shipping, Zendrop, or direct manufacturer relationships found on 1688.com. (2) Product criticality tiers: Tier A (top 10 sellers, 60% of revenue) — must have verified backup supplier with sample tested quality. Tier B (next 15 products, 30% of revenue) — identify backup but no need to pre-test. Tier C (remaining products, 10% of revenue) — acceptable to go out of stock temporarily. (3) Switching protocol: if CJ reports delays exceeding 3 days on a Tier A product, automatically route new orders to backup. Pre-negotiated terms: have pricing and shipping agreements in place before you need them. (4) Inventory buffer strategy: for Tier A products, maintain 1-week inventory in CJ US warehouse. Cost: $2,000-$3,000 in pre-purchased inventory. Insurance against disruption: priceless. (5) Quarterly supplier review: compare CJ performance vs backup on cost, shipping speed, quality, and responsiveness. Use data to negotiate better terms with primary and keep backup sharp.',

Each stream has a designated owner who monitors weekly. (2) Orient — contextualize data with benchmarks and trends. A 2% conversion rate means nothing without context: is it up or down vs last month? vs industry benchmark? vs your own target? Create a context layer for every metric: current value, trend (up/down/flat), benchmark, and target. (3) Decide — use a decision matrix: if metric is below target AND trending down, take immediate corrective action. If below target but trending up, continue current course with monitoring. If above target, investigate what is working and double down. Every significant decision gets documented with: the data that informed it, the expected outcome, and the review date. (4) Act — implement within 48 hours of decision. No decision should sit in limbo. Review outcomes 2-4 weeks later and feed back into the observation step. Building data culture: start every weekly meeting with 3 metrics, not 3 opinions. Reward team members who challenge assumptions with data.',

Their brand has strong recognition and would add credibility to your store. However, managing branded products alongside your dropshipped items creates pricing complexity.',
    challenge: 'Structure a brand partnership pricing strategy. How do you price branded products alongside your existing catalog? How do you negotiate terms? What are the financial and brand implications?',
    optimalApproach: 'Pricing structure: Brand products serve a dual purpose — revenue and credibility. Price branded products at 15-20% below the brand\'s direct retail price. This gives customers a reason to buy through your store while maintaining healthy margins (you bought at 50% wholesale, selling at 80-85% of retail = 35-42% margin). Catalog integration: Position branded products as your "Premium" or "Featured" collection. They anchor the perceived quality of your entire store upward. Your private label products sit alongside, benefiting from the halo effect. Negotiation strategy: (1) Start with the $2,000 minimum to test demand. (2) Negotiate exclusive online rights for specific SKUs in your niche — this prevents the brand from undercutting you on Amazon. (3) Request co-marketing support — branded content, social media mentions, email features. (4) Propose a tiered pricing structure: better wholesale rates at $5K and $10K monthly volume. Financial modeling: branded products at 37% margin vs your current 45% blended margin. The lower margin is offset by: higher conversion rate (brand trust), higher AOV (premium pricing), and lower CAC (brand recognition reduces ad spend needed).
